chapter 17


in the market-place


on saturday boldwood was in casterbridge market house as usual, when
the disturber of his dreams entered and became visible to him.  adam
had awakened from his deep sleep, and behold! there was eve.  the
farmer took courage, and for the first time really looked at her.

material causes and emotional effects are not to be arranged in
regular equation.  the result from capital employed in the production
of any movement of a mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the
cause itself is absurdly minute.  when women are in a freakish mood,
their usual intuition, either from carelessness or inherent defect,
seemingly fails to teach them this, and hence it was that bathsheba
was fated to be astonished to-day.

boldwood looked at her--not slily, critically, or understandingly,
but blankly at gaze, in the way a reaper looks up at a passing
train--as something foreign to his element, and but dimly understood.
to boldwood women had been remote phenomena rather than necessary
complements--comets of such uncertain aspect, movement, and
permanence, that whether their orbits were as geometrical,
unchangeable, and as subject to laws as his own, or as absolutely
erratic as they superficially appeared, he had not deemed it his duty
to consider.
